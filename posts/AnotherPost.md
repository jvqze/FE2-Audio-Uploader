Doubt. That is something we have all faced at one time or another. Whether it's a decision you can't seem to make, a path that you're not so sure of, or even a risk that you're really not willing to take, doubt somehow manages to seep in and make us question just about everything we do.

But let's get real for a second: doubt is natural. It's the way our brains try to protect us from the unknown—from the discomfort of going beyond the comfort zone. While overwhelming, doubt is also an opportunity.

Next time you doubt, ask yourself: *Why do I even feel this way?* Perhaps it's because you are resistant to failure, to judgment, or just because the stakes seem too high. Understanding where the doubt comes from will help in fighting it.

Think of all those times when you *did* push through the doubt. Remember that feeling of stepping out of that comfort zone and realizing you could do something you didn't think you could do?

So, what if, instead of doubt paralyzing you, you used it as a signal—an invitation to grow? After all, growth happens outside of comfort. The question is, are you ready to embrace it?

Whatever you are doubting today, just know you are not alone. We all go through this, but the difference between those who stay stuck and the ones who move further on is through action. Now, take that leap, no matter how much doubt fills the air.

You will never know how far you can go unless you try.
