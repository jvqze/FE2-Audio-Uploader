                                        Hey there, the names is Jaylen! I've had the interest in
                                        coding since I was 7 years old. That is a somewhat a very
                                        young age but coding was something I'm proud of wanting to
                                        do!

                                        All through these years, I grew into an individual who
                                        deeply analyzed each and every little thing that crossed my
                                        path but found pleasure in taking paths not usually taken.
                                        My curiosity nurtured an endless love for computer science,
                                        the field challenging me in the very best possible manner.
                                        I've spent countless hours diving into projects, some with
                                        mainstream technologies like React, while others leverage
                                        obscure tools like Lua or frameworks most people don't even
                                        know about. In fact, it's rather exciting to work on things
                                        that other people find complex or little known, but that is
                                        just one of the things that makes it so rewarding for me.

                                                has been the major factor in my growth concerning
                                                computer science and life in general. Working as
                                                part of a team has taught me to approach problems
                                                with flexibility and openness, considering that each
                                                member comes with something different. I have been
                                                accorded many opportunities to work on projects both
                                                at work and at school, whereby striking a balance
                                                between different thinking has paid off in creating
                                                creative solutions. These experiences have taught me
                                                how to communicate, how to overcome obstacles as a
                                                team, and how to appreciate the true meaning of
                                                teamwork in achieving success.

                                        Overall, these main motivating factors in my personal and
                                        professional development have been helping me in my growth
                                        as a person and improving. Leading teams taught me the ways
                                        of taking initiative, making confident decisions, and
                                        inspiring others to work towards one common goal. At the
                                        same time, being part of a team has allowed me to realize
                                        the value of collaboration and shared effort. Presently, I
                                        have learned how to communicate, listen to other people's
                                        perspectives, and balance different personalities. All these
                                        experiences not only strengthened my problem-solving and
                                        organizing skills but also helped me as a person to become
                                        resilient, adaptive, and full of responsibility in
                                        everything that I do.
