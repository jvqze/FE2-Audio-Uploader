                            It's been nearly two months since we first got together (not that it matters but.. it felt longer), and I can't
                            help but reflect on how incredible this time has been. From our
                            spontaneous car rides to upstate New York to the little moments we share
                            daily, every experience with you has been nothing short of magical.
                            <br></br>
                            <br></br>I still remember the day you wrote me that heartfelt letter.
                            Your words captured so much of what we share, and I was touched beyond
                            measure. It‚Äôs rare to find someone who can articulate their feelings so
                            deeply and genuinely, and through that letter, I felt a connection with
                            you that only grew stronger.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            You always tell me that you‚Äôve found your person in me, and each time
                            you say it, my heart swells with happiness. I feel the same way about
                            you. The countless things you‚Äôve done for me, the times you‚Äôve been
                            there when I needed you most, and the unwavering support and love you‚Äôve
                            shown have made me realize how special our bond is. Our intimacy isn‚Äôt
                            just about physical closeness; it‚Äôs a deep, emotional connection that
                            truly defines what love means.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            One of my favorite things is sending you those love-filled reels that
                            remind me of us. Each one represents a piece of our story, a snapshot of
                            our journey together. They are small tokens that reflect how much fun we
                            have and the depth of our feelings for each other.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Being with you has shown me what true love feels like. It‚Äôs the little
                            moments, like laughing at a shared joke, holding hands during our long
                            drives, or simply being in each other‚Äôs presence, that make our
                            relationship so meaningful. You bring so much joy and happiness into my
                            life, and I am incredibly grateful for you.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Chris, you are my rock, my confidant, and my best friend. Your love and
                            support mean everything to me, and I cherish every moment we spend
                            together. Thank you for being who you are and for making me feel so
                            loved and valued.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            Here‚Äôs to many more months and years of shared adventures, endless
                            laughter, and deepening love. I am so lucky to have you in my life, and
                            I can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds for us.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            From your boyfriend, Jaylen{" "}

Now I'm writing this on my phone @ 3:36 AM, Chris. I cannot sleep at the moment, just having some troubles. I just want to reflect back on what I thought about before meeting you. I was always thinking on, while the duration to going to the thai dinner place we went to is if this actual date would go good or I would make it bad. I also had thoughts and hoping that I would meet someone refreshing and actually not bad. And...I did! You're actually amazing Christopher. You've refreshed my mind and really see something in the future for this relationship. As I've told you before, the relationship I had before...was not very similar at all like this one. You know that I've been physically/mentally abused which isn't that much a touchy subject for me anymore. I've been hit, brusied where to the point I have a permanent mark, and forced to do things I didn't like. This has gone to a certain point where I almost ended my life... I started being scared and felt like my life was being outrageously controlled. But now... I feel...amazing. He left a pretty bad open cut (not physically), and it's being carefully taken care of...by you :) I love you, Chris. You truly mean a lot to me, the future ahead of us looks bright in my eyes ‚ù§Ô∏è </p>
